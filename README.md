# Udemy Progress Reset button

## Overview
This is a small JavaScript script designed to add a "Reset Progress" button to your Udemy courses. It allows you to easily reset the progress of a course, which is particularly useful if you want to start over or review the course from the beginning.

## How it Works
The script dynamically adds a "Reset Progress" button to the Udemy course interface. When clicked, it unchecks all the checkboxes for the opened sections of the course, effectively resetting your progress. Note: All course sections must be open for the button to work correctly.

## Installation
To use the script, follow these steps:
1. Open your desired course on Udemy.
2. Ensure that all course sections are expanded.
3. Open your browser's developer tools (usually F12 or right-click > Inspect).
4. Go to the Console tab.
5. Copy and paste the script into the console.
6. Press Enter to run the script.
7. You should now see the "Reset Progress" button added to the course interface.

## Usage
Simply click on the "Reset Progress" button that appears on the course interface. The script will automatically uncheck all completed sections, resetting your progress.
