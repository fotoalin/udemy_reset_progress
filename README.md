# Udemy Progress Reset button

## Overview
This is a small JavaScript script designed to add a "Reset Progress" button to your Udemy courses, enabling you to reset the progress of a course. It is particularly useful for starting over or reviewing the course from the beginning. Please note that the script will only reset the progress of sections that are currently opened.

## How it Works
The script dynamically adds a "Reset Progress" button to the Udemy course interface. When clicked, it unchecks all the checkboxes for the opened sections of the course, effectively resetting your progress. Note: All course sections must be open for the button to work correctly.

## Installation
To use the script, follow these steps:
1. Open your desired course on Udemy.
2. Ensure that all course sections are expanded.
3. Open your browser's developer tools (usually F12 or right-click > Inspect).
4. Go to the Console tab.
5. Copy and paste the script into the console.
6. Press Enter to run the script.
7. You should now see the "Reset Progress" button added to the course interface.

## Usage
To use the script, simply click on the "Reset Progress" button that appears on the the course interface top bar after following the installation steps. The script will uncheck all completed checkboxes for the sections that are currently opened, effectively resetting your progress in those sections. Ensure that you expand the sections you want to reset before using the button.
